# 📊 Power BI Dashboards

This folder contains a collection of professional business intelligence dashboards created with **Microsoft Power BI**. These dashboards are designed for deep data analysis, enterprise-level reporting, and seamless integration with existing business systems.

### 🎯 Why Power BI?

I use Power BI when a project requires robust data modeling, advanced calculations (using DAX), and secure sharing within a corporate environment. It is an industry-standard tool for creating comprehensive, interactive reports that connect directly to a wide range of data sources, from Excel spreadsheets to large-scale databases.

## 📂 How to Explore This Folder

Each subfolder in this directory represents a complete Power BI project. Inside a project folder, you will typically find:
-   **The `.pbix` file:** The main Power BI report file.
-   **A `README.md`:** A detailed breakdown of that specific dashboard's purpose, data sources, and key insights.
-   **Screenshots or a video demo:** Since Power BI files are best viewed in the desktop app or online service, I provide visuals to showcase the dashboard.

These Power BI dashboards demonstrate my ability to:
