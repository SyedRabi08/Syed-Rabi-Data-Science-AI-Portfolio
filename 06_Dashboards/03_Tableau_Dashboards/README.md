# 📈 Tableau Dashboards

This folder contains a portfolio of interactive dashboards and visual analytics projects built with **Tableau**. These dashboards are crafted for best-in-class data visualization, deep exploratory analysis, and compelling data storytelling.

### 🎨 Why Tableau?

I leverage Tableau when a project demands superior visual clarity, intuitive user-driven exploration, and the ability to handle very large datasets for visual analysis. It is the premier tool for transforming raw data into an interactive, compelling narrative that can be understood by anyone in the organization.

## 📂 How to Explore This Folder

Each subfolder within this directory is a complete Tableau project. Inside, you will typically find:
-   **The `.twbx` file:** The packaged Tableau workbook, which contains the dashboard and all necessary data.
-   **A `README.md`:** A detailed explanation of the project's goals, data sources, and key visual insights.
-   **Screenshots or a GIF:** Since `.twbx` files require Tableau Desktop or Tableau Cloud to view, I provide high-quality visuals to showcase the dashboard's design and functionality.
