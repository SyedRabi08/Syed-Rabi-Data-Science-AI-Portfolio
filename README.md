# Syed Rabi — Data-Driven Business Impact Specialist

**Hi! I’m Syed Rabi (Syed Rabi ul Hassan)**  
I help businesses of all types unlock value from their data — turning raw numbers into clear decisions, smart models and sustainable workflows.

## 🔍 What I Do  
- I build end-to-end data solutions: from **data gathering and cleaning**, through **modelling and insights**, to **deployment and maintenance**.  
- I don’t just hand you a model — I show you *how to use it* and *how your team can adopt it*.  
- I operate solo, lead teams when needed, and focus on business outcomes (not just code).

1. **Business Data Analysis & Research**  
   Understand your data, spot trends, uncover opportunities — e.g., using the “Superstore” dataset or real-world billing/retail data.  
2. **Predictive Models & Automation**  
   Build models that forecast outcomes (sales, churn, delays), automate reports and dashboards, free your team from manual work.  
3. **Deployment & Maintenance Support**  
   Set up live dashboards (Streamlit, Supabase, Excel), integrate into your workflow, and train you or your team for ongoing use.
