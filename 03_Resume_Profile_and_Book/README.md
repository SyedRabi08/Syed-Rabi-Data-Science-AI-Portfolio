## 📖 My Book: Data Science for Beginners

I wrote this book to bridge the gap between complex theory and practical application. It's designed for anyone who wants to understand data science from the ground up, using simple language and clear examples.

**Why does this matter to you as a client?**
This book is proof of my ability to not only *execute* data science projects but also to *explain* the process and insights clearly. When we work together, I won't just give you a model—I'll ensure you and your team understand it, can use it confidently, and can maintain it long-term.

## 💼 Why These Assets Matter

- **My Resume** shows you **what I can do**.
- **My Book** shows you **how I think and communicate**.

For a business, this combination is invaluable. You get a consultant who delivers technical solutions *and* empowers your team with the knowledge to leverage them effectively.
